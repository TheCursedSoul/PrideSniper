    "String : A datatype called a string represents a series of characters. These are always encased in quotes (either single or double quotes). Strings, which are frequently used to represent text can comprise letters, numbers and special characters.\n",

    "Variables : A variable is a named container that has space for a value and can store values in it. Data that can changed and altered. Any data type, including texts, integers, and floating-point numbers, can be used to represent a value for a variable. These are used in programming to change data or to store data basically the main difference between a string and a variable is that a string is a specific type of data, whereas a variable is a named container that can hold any type of data, including strings. \n",
